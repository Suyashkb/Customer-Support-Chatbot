# Customer Support Chatbot (Fine-Tuned DialoGPT)

A fine-tuned conversational AI chatbot designed to handle customer support queries using Microsoft's DialoGPT model. This project adapts a general-purpose language model to a customer service context using a real-world dataset of ~27,000 instruction-response pairs.
